READ BEFORE YOU PLAY:

Welcome to the final build of Friday Night Funkin ' (Week 7)!!! 

I just want to say i dont own any rights to these assets or songs, I only did this mini FNF project build for coding practice. it would be nice if you actually support the the ACTUAL team who put this all together.
