READ BEFORE YOU PLAY:

This is a Desktop Build for Friday Night Funkin' v0.2.8, one of the versions of the game thats only on a select few of web-pages, and no site of an public source code, or any public desktop build.

I just want to say i dont own any rights to these assets or songs, I only did this mini FNF project build for coding practice. it would be nice if you actually support the the ACTUAL team who put this all together.
